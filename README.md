Earth

Earth is a basic image processing utility for Earth observation data.  The tools are designed to be used in conjunction with other image processing systems, not instead of, although there is some overlap with some tools. As yet, Earth does not have a means of visualising images, but the power of Earth lies in its ability to be run from the command line thereby allowing automated and repetitive processing of large volumes of data.   Earth contains nearly 100 tools with others being added all the time. The native file format is flat file raw binary. This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.  The tools are broadly categorised into one of nine groups:
 
	Image manipulation tools
	Statistical analysis tools
	Filter tools
	Text processing tools
	Classification tools
	Type conversion tools
	Format conversion tools
	Radar tools
	Miscellaneous tools
